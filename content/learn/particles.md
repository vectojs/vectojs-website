# Particle Systems

`ComputeParticleEntity` is VectoJS's high-throughput particle layer. It runs a
spring physics simulation through a WebGPU compute pass, with a CPU fallback for
browsers that do not support WebGPU. Supported particle count and frame rate
depend strongly on GPU, browser, DPR, and rendering configuration; the
repository does not currently include a checked-in 100k/1M hardware benchmark.

## Particles vs `getBatchCircle`

|             | `ComputeParticleEntity`                       | `getBatchCircle` on a custom entity        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Physics     | Built-in (spring, mouse repulsion, explosion) | Manual — you update position in `update()` |
| Backend     | WebGPU compute or CPU                         | WebGL point layer                          |
| Throughput  | Hardware/workload dependent                   | Hardware/workload dependent                |
| When to use | Self-contained physics fields                 | Point clouds you control directly          |

If you need a particle field that springs into formations, reacts to the cursor,
and triggers explosions, `ComputeParticleEntity` is the right tool. If you just
want to render many dots at positions you control, implement `getBatchCircle()`
on a custom entity.

## Basic setup

```typescript
import { Scene, ComputeParticleEntity } from '@vectojs/core';

const canvas = document.querySelector<HTMLCanvasElement>('#canvas')!;

const scene = new Scene(canvas, {
  particleBackend: 'auto', // 'webgpu' | 'cpu' | 'auto' (default: tries WebGPU, falls back)
  pointBackend: 'webgl', // needed for CPU fallback rendering
  maxFPS: 60,
});

const particles = new ComputeParticleEntity({
  maxParticles: 50_000,
  springK: 0.05, // spring pull toward origin (0–10)
  damping: 0.95, // velocity damping per step (0–1)
  bounceDamping: 0.5, // energy retained on boundary bounce (0–1)
  maxVelocity: 500, // speed clamp
  size: 3, // base particle radius in px
  color: '#00f0ff',
  pointerEvents: false, // true → entity captures hit events
});

scene.add(particles);
scene.start();

// IMPORTANT: resize before calling initRandomParticles
scene.resize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);

// Scatter particles across the viewport
particles.initRandomParticles(scene.width, scene.height);

window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
  scene.resize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
});
```

> [!CAUTION] > `resize(w, h)` must be called **before** `initRandomParticles`. A `0×0` viewport means all particle positions default to `(0, 0)` and the simulation has no boundary to bounce off. `scene.start()` logs a one-time warning if width or height is zero.

## The 8-float memory layout

Each particle is 8 consecutive `float32` values in `entity.particleData`:

| Offset constant              | Index | Field      | Notes                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PARTICLE_OFFSET_POSITION_X` | 0     | position.x | Current world-space x                                        |
| `PARTICLE_OFFSET_POSITION_Y` | 1     | position.y | Current world-space y                                        |
| `PARTICLE_OFFSET_VELOCITY_X` | 2     | velocity.x |                                                              |
| `PARTICLE_OFFSET_VELOCITY_Y` | 3     | velocity.y |                                                              |
| `PARTICLE_OFFSET_ORIGIN_X`   | 4     | origin.x   | Spring rest/anchor point                                     |
| `PARTICLE_OFFSET_ORIGIN_Y`   | 5     | origin.y   |                                                              |
| `PARTICLE_OFFSET_SIZE`       | 6     | size       | Per-particle size override                                   |
| `PARTICLE_OFFSET_LIFE`       | 7     | life       | `-1` = perpetual; `≥0` decays at 0.5/s; `0` = dead (skipped) |

You can read and write `particleData` directly to set up custom formations.
After writing, set `needsInit = true` to trigger a GPU upload on the next frame.

## Forming text shapes and patterns

`setOrigins()` is the primary way to make particles spring into a formation.
Pass a flat `Float32Array` of alternating `[x0, y0, x1, y1, …]` pairs — one per
particle:

```typescript
// Arrange 10,000 particles in a grid
const N = 10_000;
const cols = 100;
const origins = new Float32Array(N * 2);

for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  const col = i % cols;
  const row = Math.floor(i / cols);
  origins[i * 2] = 100 + col * 8; // x
  origins[i * 2 + 1] = 100 + row * 8; // y
}

particles.setOrigins(origins); // also uploads particleData to GPU
```

`setOrigins(points, requestPositionReset = true)` — the second argument controls
whether particles also teleport to their new origins (useful for instant
formation changes) or spring toward them from their current positions.

To set positions without changing origins, use `setPositions()`. To set initial
velocities (e.g., a burst outward from the center), use `setVelocities()`.

All three methods write to `particleData` and set `needsInit = true`, so the
data is uploaded to the WebGPU storage buffer on the next frame.

## Mouse interaction

When `pointerEvents: true`, the `Scene` passes cursor coordinates to the
particle sim. Particles within **120 px** of the cursor are repelled:

```typescript
const particles = new ComputeParticleEntity({
  maxParticles: 100_000,
  pointerEvents: true,
});
scene.add(particles);
```

The repulsion radius and force are fixed in the shader. When the cursor leaves
the canvas, the repulsion point is set to `(-9999, -9999)` so no repulsion is
applied.

## Accessibility and hit-testing a particle field

A particle field is decorative: individually, particles carry no semantics worth
announcing, and nobody inspects one in devtools or selects it as text. Treat the
field as a single object.

**Do not set `interactive = true` per particle.** That projects one real DOM
element per entity into the semantic layer, and the cost per entity gets worse
as the count grows — measured on an RTX 4060 Laptop, 20,000 individually
interactive moving entities cost 715ms/frame on Chrome and 2,737ms/frame on
Firefox. See [the cost
table](/learn/accessibility/#cost-scales-super-linearly-with-interactive-entity-count).

Instead:

- **Label the field once.** Give the `ComputeParticleEntity` (or a wrapper) a
  single `getA11yAttributes()` returning a `role` and an `aria-label` describing
  the whole effect. One node, constant cost.
- **Hit-test without projecting.** `scene.findEntityAt(x, y)` resolves entities
  regardless of `interactive`, so pointer interaction never requires a projected
  element. `pointerEvents: true` feeds cursor coordinates to the simulation and
  is independent of the semantic layer.
- **If the effect is purely decorative, say so.** Leaving it unprojected is the
  correct answer, equivalent to `aria-hidden` on a decorative DOM element — but
  make sure any _information_ the effect conveys is also available in text.

## Triggering explosions

`triggerExplosion(x, y, force)` queues an impulse for the next simulation step.
All particles within **150 px** of `(x, y)` receive an outward velocity kick
scaled by `force`:

```typescript
canvas.addEventListener('dblclick', (e) => {
  const point = scene.clientToScene(e.clientX, e.clientY);
  particles.triggerExplosion(point.x, point.y, 800);
});
```

Only one explosion can be queued at a time — calling `triggerExplosion` before
the previous one has been consumed overwrites it.

## WebGPU vs CPU fallback

The `particleBackend` option controls which path is used:

| Value              | Behavior                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `'auto'` (default) | Tries WebGPU; falls back to CPU on failure or absence                                         |
| `'webgpu'`         | Explicitly requests WebGPU; current runtime still falls back to CPU when initialization fails |
| `'cpu'`            | Forces CPU sim; disables WebGPU even if available                                             |

**When WebGPU is active:** The sim runs as a compute shader on the GPU. Particle
state lives in a WebGPU storage buffer and renders into the Scene's dedicated
WebGPU canvas.

**When CPU fallback is active:** The `Scene` calls `entity.updateCPU(dt, mouseX,
mouseY, width, height)` each frame (same physics model — spring, repulsion,
explosion, velocity cap, bounce). Renders via `fillCircle()` on Canvas2D or the
optional WebGL point layer. Choose counts from measurements on the target
browser and hardware.

> [!NOTE] > `particles.gpuStorageBuffer !== null` shows that GPU resources were allocated,
> but it is not a reliable live backend status after asynchronous device loss.

Device loss is auto-recovered with exponential backoff (3 retries) before
permanently disabling WebGPU for the session.

### Reading particle positions back from the GPU

The particle state lives in a GPU buffer. You cannot read it back cheaply — a
`mapAsync` + `copyBufferToBuffer` round-trip stalls the pipeline. If you need
positions on the CPU (e.g., for collision detection with non-particle entities),
keep a CPU-side `Float32Array` in sync by writing to `particleData` yourself and
using `setPositions()`.

For large-scale spatial queries entirely within the particle system, write
additional WebGPU compute passes. For collision with other entities, use
`SpatialHashGrid` on the CPU path.

## GPU resource management

```typescript
// Clean up GPU buffers when done (e.g. on page unload or component teardown)
particles.destroyGPUResources();
scene.remove(particles);
```

`scene.destroy()` also calls `destroyGPUResources()` on all particle entities,
so you only need to call it manually for mid-session teardown.

## TypeScript types for WebGPU

If your project uses WebGPU APIs and TypeScript reports `Cannot find name
'GPUDevice'`:

```bash
bun add -d @webgpu/types
```

```json
{ "compilerOptions": { "types": ["@webgpu/types"] } }
```

## Troubleshooting

### Nothing appears on screen

Check in order:

1. **`initRandomParticles()` was not called** — without this, all particle
   positions are `(0, 0)` and sizes are `0`.
2. **`resize(w, h)` was not called before `initRandomParticles`** — particles
   scattered across a `0×0` box are invisible. Check `scene.width` and
   `scene.height` are non-zero.
3. **WebGPU initialization failed** — the current runtime logs the failure,
   disables the GPU path, and continues through the CPU fallback even when
   `'webgpu'` was explicitly requested.
4. **`pointBackend` not set to `'webgl'`** — the CPU fallback renders via
   `fillCircle`. Without `'webgl'`, CPU-path particles still appear on Canvas2D,
   but only if the canvas renderer is active.

### Frame times are worse than expected

- Read frame-time percentiles, not FPS: FPS is vsync-capped and saturates, so it
  can read a healthy 60 while the scene idles most of each frame — and it will
  not move when you fix the real bottleneck. See [measuring real
  performance](/learn/performance/#do-not-use-fps-as-your-metric).
- Use browser GPU tooling and the WebGPU canvas to verify the active path; a
  retained `gpuStorageBuffer` alone is not a durable status signal after device
  loss.
- In headless / CI environments, WebGPU and WebGL fall back to software
  renderers (Swiftshader). Headless numbers are not representative. Measure on
  real GPU hardware.
- Reduce `maxParticles` while profiling and record frame-time percentiles on the
  target device; this repository does not establish a universal CPU or GPU cap.
- Check nothing set `interactive = true` per particle — that projects a DOM
  element each and dominates frame time well before the renderer does.

### Particles spring to `(0, 0)` instead of my formation

`setOrigins()` and `setPositions()` both set `needsInit = true`, which uploads
`particleData` to the GPU buffer on the next frame. If you call them **before**
`scene.start()`, make sure `start()` is called afterward so the upload happens.
