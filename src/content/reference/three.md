# `@vectojs/three`

Two exports, two distinct use cases:

| Export          | Use case                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ThreeAdapter`  | Render a VectoJS `Scene` onto an offscreen canvas, expose it as a `THREE.CanvasTexture`, and wire pointer events via UV raycasting. The rest of your Three.js scene is untouched. |
| `ThreeRenderer` | Use Three.js as the 2D rendering backend for a VectoJS `Scene` — fills, strokes, and text become Three.js meshes in an orthographic scene rather than Canvas 2D draw calls.       |

`ThreeAdapter` is the common path: you have a 3D scene and want a 2D UI panel floating on a surface. `ThreeRenderer` is for projects that already commit to Three.js and want hardware-accelerated 2D primitives with no Canvas 2D fallback.

## Installation

```sh
bun add @vectojs/three three
```

For TypeScript projects, add the Three.js types:

```sh
bun add -d @types/three
```

---

## ThreeAdapter

`ThreeAdapter` creates an offscreen `HTMLCanvasElement`, renders a VectoJS `Scene` onto it, wraps the result as a `THREE.CanvasTexture`, and gives you a ready-to-use `THREE.Mesh` (a unit `PlaneGeometry` with a `MeshBasicMaterial`). Pointer and scroll events from your Three.js event listeners are translated back into VectoJS canvas coordinates via raycasting.

### Constructor

```ts
new ThreeAdapter(options: ThreeAdapterOptions)
```

```ts
interface ThreeAdapterOptions {
  width: number; // physical layout width of the 2D UI canvas (px)
  height: number; // physical layout height (px)
  canvas?: HTMLCanvasElement; // optional pre-existing canvas; adapter creates one if omitted
  sceneOptions?: SceneOptions; // forwarded to the VectoScene constructor
}
```

`disableWindowResize` is forced to `true` internally regardless of what you pass in `sceneOptions` — the adapter owns resize via `resize(w, h)`, not the window.

### Public properties

| Property     | Type                  | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `texture`    | `THREE.CanvasTexture` | The texture wrapping the offscreen VectoJS canvas. Set `needsUpdate = true` automatically after every VectoJS render frame. |
| `vectoScene` | `VectoScene`          | The active VectoJS `Scene` instance. Add entities to this.                                                                  |
| `canvas`     | `HTMLCanvasElement`   | The offscreen canvas onto which VectoJS draws.                                                                              |
| `mesh`       | `THREE.Mesh`          | Pre-built `PlaneGeometry(1, 1)` + `MeshBasicMaterial` mesh ready to drop into your Three.js scene.                          |

### Methods

#### `updateIntersection(raycaster, type, originalEvent?)`

```ts
updateIntersection(
  raycaster: THREE.Raycaster,
  type: 'pointerdown' | 'pointerup' | 'pointermove' | 'wheel' | 'click',
  originalEvent?: PointerEvent | WheelEvent
): boolean
```

Cast the ray against the adapter mesh, translate the UV hit into VectoJS canvas coordinates, and dispatch the event into the VectoJS scene. Returns `true` when the ray intersected the mesh.

Call this from within your Three.js render loop or pointer-event listeners. The adapter maintains per-`pointerId` hover state so WebXR controllers and multi-touch inputs each carry independent hover/focus contexts.

**UV remapping**: Three.js UV coordinates have Y=0 at the bottom of a plane; VectoJS has Y=0 at the top. The adapter flips the Y axis automatically — you do not need to adjust coordinates.

#### `resize(width, height)`

```ts
resize(width: number, height: number): void
```

Resize the offscreen canvas and the underlying `VectoScene`. Call when the panel's world-space display size changes.

#### `dispose()`

```ts
dispose(): void
```

Disposes the `THREE.CanvasTexture`, geometry, and material on the mesh, destroys the `VectoScene`, and clears all per-pointer state. Call when unmounting the panel from the scene.

### Complete example

The following example renders a VectoJS settings panel on a rotating plane in a Three.js scene. Pointer events from the `pointermove`, `pointerdown`, and `pointerup` DOM listeners are forwarded into VectoJS via `updateIntersection`.

```ts
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { ThreeAdapter } from '@vectojs/three';
import { Text, Button, Stack } from '@vectojs/ui';

// --- Three.js scene setup ---
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

const threeScene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(60, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 100);
camera.position.set(0, 0, 3);

// --- VectoJS panel adapter (512×256 logical pixels, displayed on a 2×1 plane) ---
const adapter = new ThreeAdapter({ width: 512, height: 256 });

const heading = new Text('Settings', { font: '600 24px Inter', color: '#f8fafc' });
const applyBtn = new Button('Apply', { width: 120, height: 40 });
applyBtn.on('click', () => console.log('apply clicked'));

const stack = new Stack({ direction: 'vertical', gap: 20 });
stack.add(heading);
stack.add(applyBtn);
stack.setPosition(20, 20);
adapter.vectoScene.add(stack);

adapter.vectoScene.start();

// --- Place mesh in the Three.js scene ---
const panel = adapter.mesh;
panel.scale.set(2, 1, 1); // world-space size matches the 2:1 aspect ratio
threeScene.add(panel);

// --- Raycaster for event translation ---
const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
const pointer = new THREE.Vector2();

function updatePointer(event: PointerEvent) {
  pointer.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  pointer.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
}

window.addEventListener('pointermove', (e) => {
  updatePointer(e);
  raycaster.setFromCamera(pointer, camera);
  adapter.updateIntersection(raycaster, 'pointermove', e);
});

window.addEventListener('pointerdown', (e) => {
  updatePointer(e);
  raycaster.setFromCamera(pointer, camera);
  adapter.updateIntersection(raycaster, 'pointerdown', e);
});

window.addEventListener('pointerup', (e) => {
  updatePointer(e);
  raycaster.setFromCamera(pointer, camera);
  adapter.updateIntersection(raycaster, 'pointerup', e);
});

window.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  updatePointer(e);
  raycaster.setFromCamera(pointer, camera);
  adapter.updateIntersection(raycaster, 'click', e);
});

window.addEventListener('wheel', (e) => {
  updatePointer(e as unknown as PointerEvent);
  raycaster.setFromCamera(pointer, camera);
  adapter.updateIntersection(raycaster, 'wheel', e);
});

// --- Render loop ---
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  panel.rotation.y += 0.005;
  renderer.render(threeScene, camera);
}

animate();

// --- Cleanup ---
window.addEventListener('unload', () => adapter.dispose());
```

### How the adapter works internally

The constructor monkey-patches `vectoScene.render` to set `texture.needsUpdate = true` after each VectoJS frame. Three.js then uploads the canvas to the GPU on the next `renderer.render()` call. No polling or manual sync is required.

Hit events dispatched by `updateIntersection` are forwarded to the entity's accessibility DOM element when one exists **and is connected to a live document** (which routes them through the a11y shadow layer and fires `click`/`change` on interactive components), or directly as `VectoJSEvent` objects otherwise.

> [!NOTE]
> In practice, this means `ThreeAdapter` panels always take the direct `VectoJSEvent` path, never the a11y-DOM path. The adapter's canvas is offscreen by design (it's rendered into a texture, never inserted into the page), so `@vectojs/core`'s a11y shadow root is created but never attached to `document` — a11y elements exist but are permanently disconnected. `@vectojs/three@0.1.1+` correctly detects this and routes through the entity dispatch path instead of attempting a DOM dispatch a disconnected element can't safely receive (earlier versions dispatched to the detached element anyway, which could throw from native APIs like `setPointerCapture` inside a component's own event handlers). This doesn't affect `Toggle`/`Button` click interactions, which work the same either way — but it does mean a panel hosted in `ThreeAdapter` never gets real DOM focus/IME/screen-reader behavior for its projected elements, unlike the same components rendered in a normal, DOM-attached `@vectojs/core` scene.

## WebXR and multi-touch

`updateIntersection` tracks hover state per `pointerId` taken from `originalEvent`. In a WebXR session, each controller carries its own `pointerId`, so hovering with one controller does not interfere with the state of the other. Pass the raw `XRInputSourceEvent` wrapped in a synthetic `PointerEvent` with the controller's `inputSource.handedness` encoded as the `pointerId` (0 for left, 1 for right) to maintain independent hit state.

```ts
// WebXR example — minimal controller event forwarding
session.addEventListener('selectstart', (xrEvent) => {
  const synth = new PointerEvent('pointerdown', {
    pointerId: xrEvent.inputSource === leftController ? 0 : 1,
  });
  raycaster.setFromCamera(controllerUV, camera);
  adapter.updateIntersection(raycaster, 'pointerdown', synth);
});
```

## ThreeRenderer

`ThreeRenderer` implements the `IRenderer` interface from `@vectojs/core` using Three.js — fills, strokes, and text are rendered as Three.js meshes and lines into an orthographic scene rather than Canvas 2D operations. Use it when Three.js is already in your project and you want the VectoJS scene itself rendered with the WebGL pipeline instead of Canvas 2D.

### When to use

- Your project has an existing `THREE.WebGLRenderer` and you want VectoJS's 2D content to render into the same WebGL context.
- You need hardware-accelerated gradient fills backed by GLSL shaders.
- You are benchmarking or experimenting with a pure-WebGL 2D pipeline.

For embedding a 2D UI onto a 3D surface, prefer `ThreeAdapter` instead — it does not require you to give up Canvas 2D rendering.

### Constructor

```ts
new ThreeRenderer(canvas: HTMLCanvasElement)
```

Creates:

- `THREE.WebGLRenderer` with `{ canvas, alpha: true, antialias: true }`
- `THREE.OrthographicCamera` with Y pointing down (top = 0, bottom = height) to match VectoJS's coordinate system
- Pixel ratio set to `window.devicePixelRatio` automatically

### Public properties

| Property   | Type                       |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| `scene`    | `THREE.Scene`              |
| `camera`   | `THREE.OrthographicCamera` |
| `renderer` | `THREE.WebGLRenderer`      |

### Usage

Pass the renderer as the `renderer` option to the VectoJS `Scene` constructor:

```ts
import { Scene } from '@vectojs/core';
import { ThreeRenderer } from '@vectojs/three';

const canvas = document.querySelector<HTMLCanvasElement>('#canvas')!;
const threeRenderer = new ThreeRenderer(canvas);

const scene = new Scene(canvas, { renderer: threeRenderer });
scene.add(/* entities */);
scene.start();
```

### Linewidth caveat

`THREE.LineBasicMaterial.linewidth` is **silently ignored by WebGL on most platforms** — lines are capped at 1 px regardless of the value passed to `stroke()`. This is a browser/GPU driver limitation, not a VectoJS restriction.

If your design requires thick strokes (> 1 px), consider:

- Using `fill()` with a rectangular path instead of `stroke()` for straight lines.
- Switching to `ThreeAdapter` with the default `CanvasRenderer`, which supports arbitrary line widths via Canvas 2D.
- Integrating `THREE.MeshLine` manually in your application layer — `ThreeRenderer` does not bundle this dependency.

---

## Gradient support

`ThreeRenderer.createLinearGradient()` returns a `WebGLGradient` descriptor. When passed to `fill()`, the renderer compiles a GLSL `ShaderMaterial` with the following uniform layout:

```glsl
uniform vec4 u_grad_colors[8];  // RGBA per stop
uniform float u_grad_stops[8];  // normalized position [0, 1]
uniform int u_grad_count;       // active stop count (≤ 8)
uniform vec2 u_grad_start;      // world-space start point
uniform vec2 u_grad_end;        // world-space end point
```

Color is interpolated linearly between the two nearest stops in world space. If more than 8 stops are provided, they are resampled to 8 evenly-spaced points before upload — color detail beyond 8 stops is lost.

**Gradients are not supported for `stroke()` or `fillText()`.** Passing a `WebGLGradient` to `stroke()` falls back to the first stop color. `fillText()` also falls back to the first stop color because text glyphs are rasterized via Canvas 2D before upload.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Gradient renders as a solid color instead of blending

`stroke()` does not support gradients — it always uses the first color stop as a solid color. Use `fill()` with a closed path if you need a gradient-painted shape outline effect.

Also verify that you are calling `createLinearGradient()` from `ThreeRenderer` (returns a `WebGLGradient`) and not from a `CanvasRenderingContext2D` — mixing renderer gradient objects across implementations produces undefined behavior.

### Text appears blurry on high-DPI displays

`ThreeRenderer` sets `window.devicePixelRatio` automatically in its constructor. If you are using a custom `CanvasRenderer` (the default) via `ThreeAdapter`, verify that the offscreen canvas dimensions account for device pixel ratio:

```ts
const dpr = window.devicePixelRatio;
const adapter = new ThreeAdapter({ width: logicalWidth * dpr, height: logicalHeight * dpr });
adapter.mesh.scale.set(logicalWidth / 100, logicalHeight / 100, 1); // scale in world space
```

Then set `canvas.style.width` / `canvas.style.height` to logical pixels if the canvas is ever inserted into the DOM.

### Pointer events have no effect on VectoJS components

`updateIntersection()` must be called on every frame where input should be processed — it is not enough to call it only in DOM event listeners, because the raycaster needs the current camera and mesh state at the time of the event. Confirm:

1. `updateIntersection()` is called inside your render loop (or directly in pointer-event handlers with a freshly set raycaster).
2. The raycaster's camera matches the camera used to render the scene.
3. `adapter.mesh` is part of the Three.js scene graph when the ray is cast — orphan meshes (not added to the scene) are not intersected.
4. `adapter.vectoScene.start()` has been called — VectoJS does not process events until the scene loop is running.
