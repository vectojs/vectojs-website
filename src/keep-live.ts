 * Keep a continuously-animated scene rendering at full rate despite the idle
 * auto-throttle added in core@0.1.0 (a "static" scene — no dirty flag, no pending
 * tween — drops to ~2 FPS). Demos that move entities by hand in `update()` aren't
 * seen as animating, and marking dirty *inside* `update()` is futile: the loop
 * resets `dirty` right after rendering. So we mark dirty from a standalone rAF
 * that runs *between* frames.
 *
 * `active()` gates the pump — return `false` (e.g. while paused) to let the scene
 * throttle and save resources. Returns a stop function.
